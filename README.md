## üåü About the Project
IMAGENE, the ComicCrafter AI, is a generative AI-based comic generator designed to run locally on edge devices. It seamlessly transforms user-provided prompts into captivating comic-style stories using cutting-edge technologies like Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformer and Stable Diffusion XL. It utilizes LLaMA and Stable Diffusion to generate comic panels with text bubbles from user prompts, using cloud-based processing to deliver AI-powered visual storytelling from textual input.

## ‚ú® Features
- **AI-Generated Stories:** Users input a prompt, and the AI autonomously crafts a complete comic storyline.
- **Dynamic Illustrations:** Stable Diffusion XL generates vibrant comic panels aligned with the story.
- **Interactive Panel Selection:** Users can choose and fine-tune specific panels to ensure the visual narrative matches their vision.
